SpringJersey
============

This is an Eclipse project that contains code showing one implementation of REST 
services implemented with Spring and Jersey. Jersey is used to implement the JAX-RS
spec instead of SpringMVC. 

* The example also goes all the way down to the repository using JPA/Hibernate and Derby. 
* Java configuration is used instead of XML
